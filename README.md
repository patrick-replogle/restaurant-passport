Restaurant Passport is an app for foodies, travelers, and couples. Eat out, rate, and log your experiences in one convenient place. Keep track of where you have eaten, or places you want to go next.

Users can register an account and login to their personal restaurant passport dashboard. Add pages to your passport, update or delete entries, and mark restaurants as visited to differentiate between places you have been or want to go.
